This is the description of the "Job Candidate Test" of the LambdaLogic GmbH (www.lambdalogic.de).

It is intended to be solved by job candidates for the software development department of LambdaLogic.
We use this test to assess the programming skills of new Java developers.

The test is based on a real-world problem that we have encountered in our software Regasus.


The task consists of 2 parts:


1. Implement the interface IBookingsCurrencyAmountsEvaluator to calculate the 
	- total amount, 
	- the total paid amount and the 
	- total open amount
of a list of bookings for a certain invoice recipient.

When doing the calculation take care that you don't mix-up gross and net amounts and do not add up rounding errors!

For example the gross amount of 0.10 € net with a tax rate of 19% is 0.10 € * 1.19 = 0.119 € ≈ 0.12 €.
But the sum of 10 times 0.10 € net with a tax rate of 19% is not 10 * 0.12 € = 1.20 € but (0.10 € * 10) * 1.19 = 1.19 €.

To ensure this, you have to read the JavaDocs of the given classes carefully!


2. Write JUnit tests to verify your implementation.


Use the given classes but do not change them, especially not the interface. 

Your code should be 
- correct,
- well tested,
- well formatted,
- well documented and 
- easy to understand. 


Please send your Java source code to s.warning@lambdalogic.de.

Don't hesitate to contact Sacha Warning (s.warning@lambdalogic.de) if you have any questions!


Good luck!
